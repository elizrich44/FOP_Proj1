 <p>
 	When I really ask myself
 </p>

 <p>
 	where on Earth my Kingdom is,
 </p>
  <p>
 	poisoning my perspective instantly,
 </p>
  <p>
 	I am urged to answer precisely with dots and lines.
 </p>
  <p>
 	It was a safe route when we were in the seeding period; swallowing the world with our eyes.
 </p>
  <p>
 	How it melts and seeps in from skin to internal organs.
 </p>
  <p>
 	A circle: of reachable things and unexpected things that 
come together to make.
 </p>
  <p>
 	Day and night, whose difference is only an amount of blue.
 </p>
 <p>Dwarf city falls down slowly.</p>
 <p>I open my eyes gradually, </p>
 <p>But I can't see the contour </p>
 <p>An unreliable Dream Horse.</p>
 <p>Asking where on Earth my Kingdom is. </p>
 <p>I'm standing fearfully inside of the dove's heart which engulfs the wind,</p>
 <p>And is penetrated by puffiness. </p>
 <p>Fulfilled as an air balloon</p>
 <p>and as opened as a shell </p>
 <p>it overflows after all.</p>
 <p>As long as we face my Kingdom from this world, </p>
 <p>and smell the flowers and moist oceans under the clouds </p>
 <p>or find the shade where the birds sing</p>
 <p>or the voice of hippopotami</p>
 <p>Stay away from the tough work of describing the deep insides of a woman</p>
 <p>and increase invisible bodies which can do more than shatter.</p>

	Editor's Note:
</p>
<p>
	Issue 4 of PROVOKE Magazine has entered the modern realm of publication and resides online via website. Though all three previous issues of PROVOKE showcased the works of Daido Moriyama, issue 4 is excited to present Jun Yamamoto. Yamamoto embodies similar styles to Moriyama, capturing the essence of Tokyo life through street photography. Issue 4 is the first of the PROVOKE issues to incorporate color photography as well as previous photographs from previous issues. The side-by-side comparisons of Yamamoto and Moriyama's photos speaks largely on the evolution of Tokyo from the 1960s to today. Major themes of this issue include: rise of consumerism culture and technological advancements in photography. We hope you enjoy this experimental issue as we plan to release more in-depth issues in the future.
